Description
What is the Challenge?
Burundi faces significant challenges in ensuring transparent and credible electoral processes due to the absence of a unique identifier for each citizen. The lack of biometric identity cards has historically led to electoral fraud, such as multiple voting and identity manipulation, undermining trust in the democratic process. With legislative, communal, and hill elections scheduled for 2025 and presidential elections in 2027, the need for a secure and reliable identification system is critical. Additionally, concerns over data security and privacy further complicate efforts to introduce robust identity verification mechanisms.

What is the envisioned blockchain solution
A blockchain-based biometric identity system can address these challenges by providing a secure, decentralized platform for managing voter identities. This system would integrate biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial recognition, with a blockchain ledger to create unique, tamper-proof identifiers for each citizen. Blockchainâ€™s immutable records would prevent identity duplication and manipulation, ensuring fair voter registration and election processes. Real-time verification at polling stations could streamline voting while maintaining transparency. Furthermore, the system would enhance data security by giving citizens control over their personal information through cryptographic keys.
