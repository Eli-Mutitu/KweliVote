# Django Authentication Configuration Summary

## Initial Configuration

- Created a Django superuser with:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin`
  - Email: `admin@example.com`

## KeyPerson to User Linking

### Requirements
- All KeyPersons should be linked to a Django user account
- Observers are the only KeyPersons who don't need user accounts

### Implementation Steps

1. **Updated KeyPerson Model**
   - Added a OneToOneField relationship to the User model
   - Added validation to ensure non-Observer KeyPersons have user accounts

2. **Enhanced Admin Interface**
   - Modified KeyPersonAdmin to display user information
   - Created a custom UserAdmin that shows KeyPerson details
   - Admin now shows username in KeyPerson list view
   - Admin displays KeyPerson role in User list view
   - Only allows selecting users not already linked to another KeyPerson

3. **Automated User Account Creation**
   - Created management command `link_keypersons_to_users.py` for linking existing KeyPersons to users
   - Added signal handler that automatically creates a user when a new non-Observer KeyPerson is created
   - Generates usernames based on first name and national ID
   - Creates secure random passwords

4. **Comprehensive Validation**
   - Non-Observer KeyPersons must have user accounts
   - Observer KeyPersons must have their observer_type specified
   - Party Agent KeyPersons must have their political_party specified

5. **Signal Registration**
   - Created a custom AppConfig in apps.py
   - Set default_app_config in __init__.py to ensure signals are loaded
