# Secure Key Management Alternatives for Voters

## Overview

This document outlines secure approaches to manage cryptographic keys on behalf of voters in the KweliVote system. These alternatives recognize that it's often impractical to ask general voters to manage their own private keys, especially in contexts with varying levels of technical literacy.

## 1. On-Demand Key Derivation from Biometrics

**How it works:** Instead of storing private keys, the system regenerates them on-demand from the voter's biometric data each time they need to authenticate.

**Benefits:**
- No persistent storage of private keys in databases
- Keys exist only in memory during the specific transaction
- Leverages our existing biometric-to-DID approach

**Implementation:**
- Store only the public key/DID in the database
- When a voter returns to vote, use their fingerprint to regenerate their private key
- Use the key for the specific transaction, then discard it

## 2. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

**How it works:** Store private keys in specialized, tamper-resistant hardware devices designed specifically for cryptographic key protection.

**Benefits:**
- Keys never leave the secure hardware
- Physical security measures against tampering
- Designed for enterprise key management

**Implementation:**
- Each polling station could have an HSM
- Keys are stored encrypted within the HSM
- Access to keys requires both biometric verification and administrative authorization

## 3. Threshold Cryptography / Multi-signature Approaches

**How it works:** Split private keys into multiple parts, requiring a threshold of parts to perform operations.

**Benefits:**
- No single entity has complete access to keys
- Compromise of a single system doesn't compromise keys
- Provides institutional checks and balances

**Implementation:**
- Split each private key into multiple shares (e.g., using Shamir's Secret Sharing)
- Distribute shares among election officials, observers, and the system
- Require multiple parties to cooperate for key operations

## 4. Secure Enclaves with Biometric Access

**How it works:** Store encrypted keys in secure enclaves (like Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone) that can only be accessed through biometric verification.

**Benefits:**
- Keys remain encrypted at rest
- Hardware-level isolation from the main operating system
- Access controlled by biometrics

**Implementation:**
- Store encrypted keys in a database
- Decrypt keys only within the secure enclave when the matching biometric is presented
- Keys never exist in decrypted form in regular system memory

## 5. Smart Cards with Biometric Activation

**How it works:** Issue smart cards to voters that store their private keys, activated only by their biometric data.

**Benefits:**
- Physical possession requirement adds security
- Keys never leave the card
- Familiar technology in many regions (similar to bank cards)

**Implementation:**
- During registration, encode the private key to a smart card
- Configure the card to require fingerprint verification before signing operations
- Cards can be reused for multiple elections

## 6. Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Authentication

**How it works:** Use zero-knowledge proof systems to allow voters to prove they control their private key without revealing it.

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced privacy
- No need to extract or recreate the actual private key
- Compatible with blockchain voting systems

**Implementation:**
- Store cryptographic commitments rather than keys
- Use ZK proofs to verify voter identity without reconstructing private keys
- Combine with biometric verification for added security

## Recommended Approach for KweliVote

For the KweliVote project, a hybrid approach is recommended:

1. **Primary Method**: Use on-demand key derivation from biometrics
   - Leverage our existing biometric-to-DID process
   - Never store complete private keys

2. **Backup System**: Implement a key escrow system using threshold cryptography
   - For recovery scenarios
   - Split key shares among trusted parties

3. **Security Principle**: Never store complete private keys in any database, even if encrypted

This approach balances security, usability, and the practical needs of a voting system while maintaining the core principles of decentralized identity systems.
