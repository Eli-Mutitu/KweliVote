# NIST Biometric Image Software (NBIS) Fingerprint Capabilities

NIST Biometric Image Software (NBIS) provides a comprehensive suite of tools for fingerprint processing. Here are the key fingerprint-related capabilities:

## Core Fingerprint Processing

1. **Template Generation (MINDTCT)**
   - Extract minutiae points from fingerprint images
   - Detect ridge endings and bifurcations
   - Generate standardized templates for matching
   - Calculate minutiae quality and reliability

2. **Fingerprint Matching (BOZORTH3)**
   - Match fingerprint templates against one another
   - Generate match scores indicating similarity
   - Support 1:1 verification and 1:N identification
   - Process both flat and rolled fingerprints

## Image Processing and Enhancement

3. **Image Quality Assessment (NFIQ & NFIQ2)**
   - Evaluate fingerprint image quality on a 1-5 scale
   - Predict matcher performance based on quality
   - Generate quality feature vectors

4. **Image Enhancement (PCASYS)**
   - Improve fingerprint image quality
   - Enhance ridge structure visibility
   - Reduce noise and artifacts

## Classification and Analysis

5. **Pattern Classification (PCASYS)**
   - Categorize fingerprints by pattern type (arch, loop, whorl)
   - Extract ridge flow and orientation maps
   - Generate fingerprint classification features

6. **Segmentation (NFSEG)**
   - Separate fingerprint foreground from background
   - Identify usable regions of prints

## Format Conversion and Standards

7. **Format Conversion**
   - Convert between proprietary and standard formats
   - Support for ANSI/NIST-ITL formats
   - WSQ fingerprint image compression/decompression
   - Conversion between ISO/IEC and NIST formats

8. **Standards Compliance**
   - Generate templates compliant with ANSI/NIST-ITL standards
   - Support for FBI's EBTS transaction formats
   - ISO/IEC 19794-2 template format support

## Advanced Features

9. **Fingerprint Visualization Tools**
   - Display fingerprint images and extracted features
   - Visualize minutiae points and ridge patterns
   - Generate orientation field maps

10. **Performance Testing**
    - Evaluate matching algorithm accuracy
    - Generate ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves
    - Calculate false match and false non-match rates
